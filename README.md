Another almost successful [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) clone.
* ***Who's creator:*** This project is a course work of 3 smart gyus and 1 great girl.
* ***Short description:*** Our task was to create the website as close as possible to the original, any libraries and preprocessors are allowed.
## What have we used in our project:
* BAM methodology
* JS modules
* Masonry librarie 
* SCSS
* Promises
* Parcel 
* Local Storage
## Additional info:
* **GIT:** during project development all the tasks were checked via [GIT-repository](https://github.com/NikolaiSenko/Clowns-Clones). 
* **Server request:** In our project we used [MockApi](https://mockapi.io/) to fetch data from remote server.
* **Group Work:** All members created new branches in GIT-repository for a new feature, bumped into conflicts and made pull requests for teamleader to check. Therefore, the work on the project was as close as possible to commercial development. 
Everyone got **invaluable experience** during group work.
So here you can check what we got at the end: (place for a link)
